Knowing this would be a semi-tough challenge, and considering I know minimal about typescript or really anything in this assesment. I called out to a couple of my computer science friends to see if they knew anything. They would not be available till later times due to finals and other events. So I started to work on my own. This involved A LOT of googling, to the point where I found resources on how to create UI's, build task managers, and many other useful tools. Unfortunatly, after around two hours I found myself back at the start where I just have everything downloaded, and not a clue as to where to go next. After a couple more hours, I learned about Bulma, so I decided to mess around with that, and I begun to atleast have a little success on getting a website working. I eventually found a youtube video series that was around 8 hours long that helped to explain to me what I needed to do, this video essentially held my hand through the process. Also, this is my first time coding in this environment, and language, so sorry for the mess of information in my repository. I took many stabs at how to start this, so there is a lot of things here that do not quite belong here. I promise that when I  code, I am much neater with my information. As the videos go on, I notice I have to change around some things in order to allow for me to follow the guidelines set by the project. For some reason, the catergories are not saving into an array due to a POST http://localhost:3000/catergory. Connection refused.
